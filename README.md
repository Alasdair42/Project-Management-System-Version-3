# Project-Management-System-Version-3
This version 3 is the same as version 2 except I am now using tables in data bases to store the date for the projects instead of text files. 
All the details of current projects are saved in tables in a data base, the details of the architect, contractor and customer are saved in tables in the data base. The details of completed projects are saved in the tables on the data base and the details of the invoices are saved in the tables in the data base. The menue which has been added allows the user to view all on going projects, view all finalized projects, view the details of all the personel involved in the projects and view the all the details of the invoices. The menue allows the user to enter in a new project will all the details, the user can enter in a new architect, contractor or customer details. The menue will allow the user to edit the due date of an ongoing project and edit the amount paid to date by client on a project. The menue will allow the user to finalize a project, create an invoice if there is still money owed on a project and input the date the project was closed, the project will be moved from the project text file to the project complete text file. Finally the menue will allow the user to see which ongoing projects are over due.
